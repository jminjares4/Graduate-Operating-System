 Problem:
        Write a multi-threaded program that computes the Catalan number
        sequence (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CatalanNumber.html) and 
        writes thosenumbers in fixed point format to a file called “catalan.dat”.
        Your program should take two command line arguments: the first specifies 
        the number of Catalan numbers to generate and the second specifies the
        number of threads to use to compute the Catalan number sequence; you can
        assume a maximum of four threads.Create a way to balance the load among
        the threads.You must use the “long double” type to get the largest range
        possible; the Catalan numbers grow very quickly. Output must be in ascending
        order (fixed point format) in the file “catalan.dat”
        -------Catalan Formula-----
        C_n+1 = 2*(2*n + 1)/(n+2) * Cn
        C_n+1 = (4n + 2)/(n+2) *Cn
        -------Catalan Formula with Factorial----
        Cn = (2*n)!/(n+1)!n!
